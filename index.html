         For the class project, you’re strongly encouraged to create your own website (I promise it’s going to be fun!). You can reuse the assets, set of colors and typography prepared by me or follow your own taste :) Download the course files ('package.zip', under 'attached files'). You’ll find there basic .html and .css files, Bootstrap framework, assets and pdf file with the style guide of the website. If you'd like to dig deeper in the .psd file of the project, please download 'hello-colors-psd.zip' package as well.
